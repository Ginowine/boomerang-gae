Boomerang converted for App Engine (Java)
==============================
This is forked from the [GDG-X boomerang] project.
GDG boilerplate, feeds from DevSite and Google+ using AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap.

This project is setup for use with both IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse. Some tweaking will be needed to point to the App Engine SDK install on your local machine. 

On IntelliJ:
You will also need to setup your own local App Engine Dev Server.

On Eclipse:
Similarly, you will need to setup your own local Run Configuration.

The paths are Linux specific, so additional path changes will be needed on Windows.

It is themed for use by GDG Space Coast, but you can modify the config.js file to have it pull from your chapter's Google+ page.
