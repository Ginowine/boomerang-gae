GDG Boomerang site converted to run on Google App Engine.
==============================
This is forked from the [GDG-X boomerang] project.
GDG boilerplate, feeds from DevSite and Google+ using AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap.

It is themed for use by GDG Space Coast, but you can modify the config.js file to have it pull from your chapter's Google+ page.
